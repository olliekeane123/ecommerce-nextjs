# eCommerce Application

This is a full-stack eCommerce application built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It provides a modern, responsive user interface and key features for an online store.

### Key Features üöÄ

-   **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration powered by **NextAuth.js** using Google as the provider.
-   **Persistent Shopping Cart**: The shopping cart is initially saved in browser **cookies** and is seamlessly migrated to the user's account in a **MongoDB** database upon login.

### Getting Started üöÄ

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/olliekeane123/ecommerce-nextjs
    cd ecommerce-nextjs
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables. You will need to configure your database connection string and NextAuth.js credentials.

    ```
    # Database
    DATABASE_URL="[your-mongodb-connection-string]"

    # NextAuth.js
    AUTH_SECRET="[a-random-secret-string]"
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="[your-google-client-id]"
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="[your-google-client-secret]"
    ```
    You can generate a strong secret string with a tool or by running `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal.

4.  **Run database migrations**:
    Prisma will generate the necessary database schema based on your `prisma/schema.prisma` file. This step is automatically handled by the `postinstall` script, but you can run it manually if needed.
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

5.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
